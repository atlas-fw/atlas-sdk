# atlas-sdk
The provided **Software Development Kit** for creating **Atlas Framework** mods.

## In progress
This project is currently Work in Progress and is not ready for public use yet.

If you're however interested in hearing the details about it, you can join our
[development discord server](https://discord.stardustenterprises.fr).

## I still want to try this!
Since this project is **VERY EARLY** in development, in order to use this
project, you'll first have to **compile** and **publish locally** the
**Atlas Framework** [gradle plugin](https://github.com/atlas-fw/atlas-gradle)
and [runtime component](https://github.com/atlas-fw/atlas-dev-runtime).

If you're stuck or need help with anything during this process, fallback to the
[***discord server***](https://discord.stardustenterprises.fr).
